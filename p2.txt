You are given two arrays A and B of the same length N indexed from 1 to N. You have to perform minimum valid operations to make array A non-decreasing.

A valid operation is as follows:

Choose any integer i between 1 to N -1.
Swap A[i] with B[i+1].
Swap A[i+1] with B[i].
If it is not possible to make the array A non-decreasing, Print -1.

Input Format

First line contains a single integer N.

Second line contains N spaced integers representing A. A[1] A[2] A[3] … A[N].

Third line contains N spaced integers representing B. B[1] B[2] B[3] … B[N].

Constraints

1 <= N <= 18.

1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 50

Output Format

Print a single integer : minimum number of operations required. And if it is impossible - print -1.

Let's choose i=1

Swap A[1] with B[2]

A = {2,4,3}

B = {3,3,3}

Now swap B[1] with A[2]

A = {2,3,3}

B = {4,3,3}

A becomes non-decreasing.
